    fix(config): Align PostgreSQL credentials and add GATEWAY_INTERNAL_SECRET
    
    CONFIGURATION FIX - Database Connection Issues
    
    Fixed inconsistent PostgreSQL credentials that prevented services from
    connecting to the database. Also added missing GATEWAY_INTERNAL_SECRET
    to main stack configuration.
    
    Changes:
    - Aligned POSTGRES_PASSWORD with DATABASE_URL password
    - Fixed POSTGRES_USER and POSTGRES_DB to match connection string
    - Added GATEWAY_INTERNAL_SECRET to .env.example
    - Added clarifying comments to prevent future misalignment
    - Set CREATE_INITIAL_ADMIN=false to avoid password validation issues
    
    Impact:
    - Identity service can now connect to PostgreSQL successfully
    - Gateway has proper internal secret configuration
    - Prevents common configuration errors for new deployments
    
    Severity: HIGH (deployment blocking)
    
    Note: This commit updates .env.example. Actual .env files are gitignored.

    the GATEWAY_INTERNAL_SECRET variable, which was previously undocumented
    but required for secure service-to-service communication.
    
    Changes:
    - Created .env.example with all gateway configuration variables
    - Marked GATEWAY_INTERNAL_SECRET as REQUIRED in README
    - Added production security checklist to .env.example
    - Updated Quick Start guide to include environment configuration
    - Added security warnings for all sensitive variables
    
    Impact:
    - Prevents insecure deployments with empty/default secrets
    - Provides clear guidance for production configuration
    - Improves onboarding experience for new deployments
    
    Severity: HIGH (configuration security)
    Related: GATEWAY_INTERNAL_SECRET was not documented before this commit

    fix(gateway): Re-enable authentication handler for HTTP endpoints (CRITICAL)
    
    SECURITY FIX - Authentication Bypass Vulnerability
    
    The auth handler was temporarily disabled for testing, leaving ALL HTTP
    API endpoints unprotected. This commit re-enables authentication to
    prevent unauthorized access.
    
    Changes:
    - Re-enabled auth_handler for /api/ location block (HTTP server)
    - Added exception for public /api/v1/identity/auth/ endpoints
    - Used access_by_lua_block instead of access_by_lua_file for consistency
    
    Impact:
    - Fixes CRITICAL authentication bypass on HTTP endpoints
    - All /api/* endpoints now require valid JWT or API key
    - Public auth endpoints (/auth/jwt/login, /auth/register) remain accessible
    
    Severity: CRITICAL
    CVE: N/A (internal finding)
    Affected versions: All versions with disabled auth handler
    Fixed: This commit

    feat: Add demo video thumbnail to README
    
    Replace static logo with clickable YouTube demo video thumbnail
    to provide immediate visual engagement for visitors.
    
    Changes:
    - Add large video thumbnail (700px) as primary visual
    - Keep Wildbox logo (reduced to 150px) below video
    - Add YouTube-styled "Watch Full Demo" button
    - All elements link to demo video: https://youtu.be/BjuTF6yJ_JA
    
    This provides better visual impact and showcases the platform
    in action rather than just a static logo.

    fix(data): allow QUICKSTART.md in Docker build context
    
    The data service Dockerfile copies both README.md and QUICKSTART.md
    but the .dockerignore was excluding QUICKSTART.md, causing builds to
    fail with 'not found' error.
    
    Root Cause:
    - .dockerignore pattern '*.md' excluded all markdown files
    - Exception '!README.md' only allowed README.md
    - QUICKSTART.md had no exception, so it was filtered out
    
    Solution:
    - Added '!QUICKSTART.md' exception to .dockerignore
    - File now passes through Docker build context
    - Both data and data-scheduler services can build successfully
    
    Technical Details:
    - Docker build context: ./open-security-data
    - Dockerfile line 30: COPY README.md QUICKSTART.md ./
    - .dockerignore exceptions must follow exclusion patterns
    
    Fixes #41
    
    Testing:
    docker-compose build data data-scheduler
    docker-compose up -d

    fix: Correct internal navigation scroll behavior in docs.html
    
    Fixed an issue where clicking sidebar navigation links did not scroll
    to the correct position. The problem was that the code was scrolling
    the entire browser window instead of the main content container.
    
    Changes:
    - Changed window.scrollTo() to document.querySelector('main').scrollTo()
    - This ensures the main content area scrolls correctly when switching
      between documentation sections
    - Affects both dynamic (fetched) and static content sections
    
    The layout uses a fixed sidebar with a scrollable main content area.
    Scrolling the window was ineffective because the main container has
    overflow-auto and independent scroll behavior.
    
    Fixes navigation for all sections including:
    - Getting Started (quickstart, credentials)
    - Security (status, policy, audit)
    - Deployment
    - API Reference (docs, security, integration)

      - Quick start commands (setup, start, stop, health)
      - Development workflow (install, dev, test, clean)
      - Production deployment automation
      - Security checks and maintenance tasks
    
    - **scripts/setup.sh**: One-command deployment script
      - Automated dependency checking
      - Secure secret generation for production
      - Support for dev/prod modes
      - Service health monitoring and migrations
    
    ## Documentation Improvements

      - Removed: SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md, SECURITY_IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md,
        SECURITY_REMEDIATION_CHECKLIST.md, SECURITY_CVE-2024-53981_REMEDIATION.md
      - Kept: SECURITY_FINDINGS.json for CI/CD integration
    
    ## Docker Optimizations
    - **Root .dockerignore**: Comprehensive build context optimization
    - **docker-compose.prod.yml**: Production configuration with:
      - Resource limits and reservations
      - Production logging configuration
      - Health check tuning
      - Redis password protection
    
    - **Service .dockerignore files** (9 services):
      - Python services: agents, identity, responder, guardian, cspm, data
      - Next.js: dashboard
      - Nginx: gateway
      - Optimized for build performance and security
    
    ## Benefits
    - Single-command deployment: `./scripts/setup.sh` or `make setup`
    - Improved build times with .dockerignore optimization
    - Better organized, searchable security documentation
    - Production-ready configurations included
    - Enhanced troubleshooting capabilities

    removed landing page (duplicate of /docs/index.html)

commit f322c13b4944df63e245ff5736f3f6567fa32611
Author: fabriziosalmi <fabrizio.salmi@gmail.com>
Date:   Sat Nov 8 08:46:21 2025 +0100

    feat: Add static API documentation links to landing-page/docs.html
    
    - Add "Static API Documentation (Recommended)" section with links to generated HTML docs
    - Links to responder-api.html, agents-api.html, and swagger-index.html
    - Keep "Live Development APIs" section for localhost endpoints during development
    - Organize documentation with clear separation between static and live APIs
    - Use relative paths (../docs/api/) for cross-directory access
    - Static docs work without running services, live docs for development
    
    This ensures landing-page has parity with main docs/docs.html for API documentation access.

Author: fabriziosalmi <fabrizio.salmi@gmail.com>
Date:   Sat Nov 8 08:45:06 2025 +0100

    fix: Fix broken API documentation links in docs.html
    
    - Mark unavailable API documentation as 'Coming Soon' (api-api, identity-api, data-api, guardian-api)
    - Only keep active links for responder-api.html and agents-api.html which have generated documentation
    - Add description for Responder Service that was previously missing
    - Prevent 404 errors when clicking unavailable API links
    
    These 4 services require full environment setup with running microservices. Documentation will be generated once services are operational.

Author: fabriziosalmi <fabrizio.salmi@gmail.com>
Date:   Fri Nov 7 15:02:28 2025 +0100

    feat: Implement comprehensive security hardening and authentication
    
    CRITICAL SECURITY FIXES:
    
    1. Authentication & Authorization
       - Added Bearer token authentication to /v1/analyze endpoint
       - Added Bearer token authentication to /v1/playbooks/{id}/execute endpoint
       - Created shared auth_utils module for reusable auth functions
       - Implemented proper token validation
    
    2. Security Headers & CORS
       - Implemented SecurityHeadersMiddleware in responder and agents
       - Added HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, CSP headers
       - Fixed CORS configuration to use environment variables
       - Removed wildcard CORS (*) - now environment-based
       - Changed default CORS from wildcard to localhost:3000
    
    3. Removed Default Secrets
       - Removed all fallback defaults from docker-compose.yml
       - DATABASE_URL now requires explicit env variable
       - JWT_SECRET_KEY now requires explicit env variable
       - API_KEY now requires explicit env variable
       - STRIPE_* keys now require explicit env variables
       - GATEWAY_INTERNAL_SECRET now requires explicit env variable
       - Secrets fail fast if not provided (better security)
    
    4. API Documentation Security
       - Added environment-based docs_url (disabled in production)
       - OpenAPI schema disabled in production mode
       - Prevents information disclosure
    
    5. Shared Security Module
       - Created open-security-shared/auth_utils.py
       - Provides reusable authentication utilities
       - AuthConfig class for configuration
       - Secure token creation and verification
       - API key validation functions
    
    6. Infrastructure Improvements
       - Environment detection (ENVIRONMENT variable)
       - Production-safe defaults
       - Comprehensive error handling
       - Proper authentication logging
    
    Updated Documentation:
       - Enhanced SECURITY.md with version 2.0
       - Added security features checklist
       - Added bug bounty program info
       - Added version history
    
    This significantly reduces the attack surface and implements
    defense-in-depth security controls.

    Fix: Critical RCE vulnerability - Remove eval() and use json.loads()
    
    Security: Replace dangerous eval() deserialization with secure JSON parsing
    - Line 207: Use json.dumps() instead of str() for Redis serialization
    - Line 267: Use json.loads() instead of eval() for deserialization
    - Added json import for proper serialization
    
    This fixes a critical Remote Code Execution vulnerability where untrusted
    Redis data could be deserialized with eval(), allowing arbitrary Python code
    execution. JSON serialization is type-safe and secure.

    - Added scripts `fix_schema_imports.sh` and `fix_tool_imports.sh` to automate the fixing of import statements in the future.
    - Removed backup files after successful import fixes to maintain a clean codebase.
